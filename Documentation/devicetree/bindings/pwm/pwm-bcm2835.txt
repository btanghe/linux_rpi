BCM2835 PWM controller (Raspberry Pi controller)

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,bcm2835-pwm"
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- clock: this clock defines the base clock frequency of the pwm 
hardware system, the period and the duty_cycle of the pwm signal is a 
multiple of the base period

Examples:

pwm@2020c000 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-pwm";
	reg = <0x2020c000 0x28>;
	clocks = <&clk_pwm>;
};

clocks {
	....
		clk_pwm: pwm {
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			reg = <3>;
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clock-frequency = <9200000>;
		};
	....
};
